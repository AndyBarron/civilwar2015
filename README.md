Notes

* Due to WebGL security restrictions, this must be run from an HTTP server;
opening index.html locally will not work properly! This simplest way to do
this is with Python.
  * Python 2.x: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`
  * Python 3.x: `python3 -m http.server`

* We use Pixi.js as our rendering engine! The documentation is available at
[http://www.goodboydigital.com/pixijs/docs/](http://www.goodboydigital.com/pixijs/docs/).
